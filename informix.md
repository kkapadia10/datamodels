Informix can be accessed at https://www.ibm.com/products/informix. Informix has been developed by IBM. 
It is [commercial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Informix), meaning it is available at a certain price and needs to be purchased to be accessed. 
Additionally, it is networked relational database. It utilizes an [object-relational](https://www.ibm.com/docs/sl/informix-servers/12.10?topic=SSGU8G_12.1.0/com.ibm.ddi.doc/ids_ddi_148.html) data model. Informix can be deployed in [client/server](https://informix.hcldoc.com/14.10/help/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.admin.doc%2Fids_admin_0123.htm), [cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/informix), and [local](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20452766/how-to-access-an-informix-database-on-localhost-windows) hosting models.
Java and Python can access Informix using the IBM Informix [JDBC Driver](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/informix-servers/12.10?topic=tools-informix-jdbc-driver-guide) and IBM Informix [Python Driver](https://github.com/OpenInformix/IfxPy), respectively. 
These drivers can be downloaded from the IBM website and [provide APIs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19460560/connect-to-informix-with-pythons-ibm-db) for connecting to, querying, and manipulating data in an Informix database.
