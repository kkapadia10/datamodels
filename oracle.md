[To connect JDBC](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39568378/python-connection-with-jdbc-to-oracle-service-name-jaydebeapi), download the Oracle JDBC driver from the Oracle website and include it in your Java application's classpath. Once you have the driver installed, you can create a JDBC connection string to connect to the database.
