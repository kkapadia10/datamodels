Apache HBase can be accessed at https://hbase.apache.org/. 
HBase was developed by Apache, but modeled after [Google's Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable). It is [open-source](https://thirdeyedata.ai/apache-hbase/#:~:text=Introduction%20to%20Apache%20Hbase,genesis%20in%20the%20Google's%20Bigtable.) 
meaning it free for everyone to access which lets the code be easily viewed, shared, or modified by the community.
Additionally, it is a NoSQL database. The hosting model for Apache HBase is [client/server](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hbase/hbase_architecture.htm#:~:text=HBase%20has%20three%20major%20components,or%20removed%20as%20per%20requirement.). 
However, it can also be deployed as a [local hosting model](https://www.engati.com/blog/install-hbase-on-mac-in-5-minutes) depending on the specific use case. It can be accessed using the [Java API](https://docs.cloudera.com/runtime/7.2.10/accessing-hbase/topics/hbase-use-the-java-api.html), [Apache Phoenix](https://phoenix.apache.org/), 
or Python libraries like [HappyBase](https://happybase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [PyHBase](https://github.com/hammer/pyhbase).
