Couchbase can be accessed at https://www.couchbase.com/. It is [commercial](https://www.quora.com/What-are-commercial-database-management-systems#:~:text=The%20popular%20commercial%20database%20management,Oracle%2C%20DB2%20and%20SQL%20Server.), meaning it is available at a certain price and needs to be purchased to be accessed. Additionally, it is a NoSQL database. It utilizes client/server and cloud-based hosting. It has native drivers, such as the [ODBC](https://www.cdata.com/drivers/couchbase/odbc/) and [JDBC](https://www.cdata.com/drivers/couchbase/jdbc/) drivers, for Java and Python. To connect the driver to python, download the SDK from the Couchbase website and include it in the project's classpath. Once the SDK package has been installed, create a Cluster object to connect to the [Couchbase cluster](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/manage/manage-nodes/create-cluster.html).
