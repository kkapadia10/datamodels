BerkeleyDB is an open-source database, meaning it has code that is [open and free for download, modification and re-use](https://www.heavy.ai/technical-glossary/open-source-database#:~:text=An%20open%20source%20database%20has,is%20protected%20to%20prevent%20copying.). 
Additionally, it is a embedded relational database. It utilizes an [embedded hosting model](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17275_01/html/programmer_reference/intro_dbis.html).
It has native APIs, such as the [open-source JDBC](http://www.ch-werner.de/javasqlite/) for Java and Python, as well as support for various other programming languages. 
Berkeley DB also uses the [Endpoint Systems](https://endpointsystems.com/products/) family of support libraries and the [.NET Core platform](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/).
